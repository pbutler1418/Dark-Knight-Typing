# Beginning to Type With Batman

The caped crusader himself has ventured out of his usual stomping grounds to stop the Jokers latest plot, to inspire anarchy in the city of Chicago. With my project, the user will act as Batmans HQ, his eye in the sky, and inform him of the latest  crime to occur and where to go to put an end to each dastardly deed by typing out commands. 

# Game Mechanics

The game will utilize the Chicago City Crime Data Base to randomly generate a crime and location for each round. Each round the user will have a set amount of time to alert Batman where to go and what to do, and if the user should fail, the round will be lost. A certain amount of rounds lost and the user will lose the game and the Joker will succeed.

# API Used

Chicago Data Portal

# MVP

In order for the game to be considered MVP, I need it to correctly use the API to generate crime data. I need the site to be able to take in input from the user and generate story content based on that that input. Lastly, I need the timer function to work to create the game aspect for the page. 

# Post MVP

Once the product is viable, there are a few additions I would like to implement. I would like to make the page as dynamic as possible, to really give the user the experience of being in the Batman-universe. If possible, id like to consult a UI cohort student to see how this would be possible. I'm thinking adding bats that flutter around the batcave would be the best way to do that.
