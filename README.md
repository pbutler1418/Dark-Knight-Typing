# Beginning to Type With Batman

Joker and his evil henchmen are at it again, brewing up mischief in Gotham, and Batman needs your help! With the Batman Begins Typing app, the user will act as Batmans HQ, his eye in the sky, and inform him of the latest crime occurances in Gothem and where to go to put an end to each dastardly deed by practicing their typing skills! 

# Game Mechanics

The game will utilize the Chicago City Crime Data Base to randomly generate a crime and location for each round. Each round the user will have to type the message that appears on the screen to tell Batman where to go and what to do, and if the message isn't typed exactly, the communication won't go through and they will have to try again.

# API Used

Chicago Data Portal

# MVP

In order for the game to reach MVP, I needed it to correctly use the API to generate crime data. I needed the site to be able to take in input from the user and generate story content based on that that input. Lastly, I needed the functions to correctly iterate through the game.

# Post MVP

Once the product is viable, there are a few additions I would like to implement. I would like to make the page as dynamic as possible, to really give the user the experience of being in the Batman-universe. I would like to return to the game to give the Batcave some moving bat animations, I would like to put some images of Batman, joker, and his henchmen so the user can actually visually follow the game. Lastly, I'd like to add a "final level" where Joker hacks the computer screen and the user has to try a rapid round of typing to fend him off.
